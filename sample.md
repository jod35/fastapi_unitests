# Advanced FastAPI Course Topics

Creating an advanced FastAPI course requires covering topics that go beyond the basics and dive into real-world, production-ready features, best practices, and integrations. Below is a structured list of advanced topics for a sophisticated FastAPI course.

## 1. Advanced FastAPI Features
- **Dependency Injection System**:
  - Creating reusable dependencies for authentication, logging, or database sessions.
  - Nested dependencies and dependency overrides for testing.
  - Example: Building a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- **Custom Request and Response Models**:
  - Advanced Pydantic usage: recursive models, custom validators, computed fields.
  - Handling complex response serialization.
  - Example: Paginated API response with metadata.
- **Background Tasks**:
  - Running long-running tasks (e.g., sending emails, generating reports).
  - Managing task queues with Celery or FastAPIâ€™s `BackgroundTasks`.
  - Example: Triggering PDF report generation.
- **WebSockets**:
  - Building real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, live notifications).
  - Handling connection management and broadcasting messages.
  - Example: Live dashboard with real-time metrics.
- **Middleware and Custom APIRoute**:
  - Writing custom middleware for logging, rate limiting, or request context.
  - Creating custom `APIRoute` classes.
  - Example: Request tracing with correlation IDs.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT and OAuth2 Integration**:
  - Secure JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
  - OAuth2 with external providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) via `Authlib`.
  - Example: API with Google OAuth2 login.
- **Role-Based and Permission-Based Authorization**:
  - Fine-grained permission systems using `fastapi-users` or custom logic.
  - Example: Admins manage users; users view own data.
- **API Key and Token Management**:
  - Securing endpoints with API keys or bearer tokens.
  - Rotating and revoking tokens.
  - Example: Multi-tenant API with tenant-specific keys.

## 3. Database Integration and Optimization
- **Advanced SQLAlchemy with Async**:
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async/await for database operations.
  - Handling complex relationships, joins, and transactions.
  - Example: Soft-delete mechanism for resources.
- **ORM vs. Raw Queries**:
  - When to use ORMs vs. raw SQL for performance.
  - Optimizing queries with indexing and profiling.
  - Example: High-performance search endpoint.
- **NoSQL Integration**:
  - FastAPI with MongoDB (`Motor`, `Beanie`) or Redis for caching.
  - Example: Recommendation API with MongoDB.
- **Database Migrations**:
  - Managing schema changes with Alembic.
  - Example: Automating migrations in CI/CD.

## 4. Performance and Scalability
- **Asynchronous Programming Deep Dive**:
  - Understanding `asyncio` and avoiding pitfalls.
  - Example: Benchmarking sync vs. async endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
  - Rate limiting with `slowapi` or custom middleware.
  - Example: Protecting API from abuse.
- **Caching Strategies**:
  - Using Redis or in-memory caching.
  - Example: Caching expensive computations.
- **Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Deploying with `uvicorn` workers and `gunicorn`.
  - Example: Load-balanced FastAPI app with Docker.

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Advanced Testing with Pytest**:
  - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
  - Mocking dependencies, databases, and APIs.
  - Example: Testing authenticated endpoints.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
  - Building features using TDD.
  - Example: Developing user profile updates.
- **Performance Testing**:
  - Stress-testing with `locust` or `k6`.
  - Example: Simulating 1,000 concurrent users.

## 6. Deployment and DevOps
- **Containerization with Docker**:
  - Optimized Dockerfiles for FastAPI.
  - Using `docker-compose` for local development.
  - Example: Production-ready Docker setup.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for testing/deployment.
  - Example: Deploying to AWS ECS or Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Structured logging with `loguru` or `structlog`.
  - Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Example: Visualizing API metrics.
- **Serverless Deployment**:
  - Deploying on AWS Lambda or Vercel.
  - Example: Serverless API with API Gateway.

## 7. Real-World Integrations
- **File Uploads and Storage**:
  - Handling large file uploads with streaming.
  - Integrating with AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
  - Example: Uploading/processing profile images.
- **Email and Notification Systems**:
  - Sending emails with `fastapi-mail` or SendGrid.
  - Example: Password reset emails.
- **GraphQL with FastAPI**:
  - Combining REST and GraphQL with `strawberry` or `ariadne`.
  - Example: Hybrid API with GraphQL for complex queries.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
  - Using RabbitMQ or Kafka for async communication.
  - Example: Order processing with inventory updates.

## 8. Security Best Practices
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
  - Preventing SQL injection, XSS, and vulnerabilities.
  - Using Pydantic for strict validation.
  - Example: Sanitizing comment system inputs.
- **CORS and CSRF Protection**:
  - Secure CORS policies and CSRF protection.
  - Example: Secure file upload endpoint.
- **Security Headers and HTTPS**:
  - Adding headers (HSTS, Content-Security-Policy).
  - Enforcing HTTPS.
  - Example: Securing API with middleware.

## 9. Advanced Project Ideas
- **E-Commerce API**:
  - Features: Product catalog, cart, payments (Stripe).
  - Topics: WebSockets, caching, async payments.
- **Task Management System**:
  - Features: Roles, tasks, file attachments, notifications.
  - Topics: RBAC, background tasks, query optimization.
- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Features: Data ingestion, live metrics, dashboards.
  - Topics: WebSockets, Redis, event-driven architecture.

## 10. Course Structure Tips
- **Modular Content**: Break into modules (e.g., Authentication, Performance).
- **Hands-On Focus**: Include exercises, quizzes, mini-projects.
- **Production-Ready Examples**: Show clean architecture.
- **Real-World Context**: Explain topic relevance.
- **Community Engagement**: Encourage sharing projects on GitHub/X.

## Suggested Starting Point
Start with **authentication and authorization** (JWT, RBAC), then move to **database integration** (async SQLAlchemy/MongoDB). Build with performance, testing, and deployment for a well-rounded course.
